### 1. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is especially useful when the problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Memoization**: Storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.
- **Tabulation**: Building a table in a bottom-up manner to store the results of subproblems.

#### Example:

Consider the Fibonacci sequence. Using DP, we can store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]
```

### 2. Prime Factorization

Prime factorization is the process of determining the prime numbers that multiply together to give a particular integer.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Prime Number**: A number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- **Factorization**: Breaking down a number into its prime factors.

#### Example:

Finding the prime factors of 28:

```python
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    while n > 1:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    return factors

print(prime_factors(28))  # Output: [2, 2, 7]
```

### 3. Code Optimization

Optimizing code involves improving its performance in terms of speed and memory usage.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Choose the right algorithm for the problem.
- **Data Structures**: Use appropriate data structures to reduce complexity.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Eliminate unnecessary calculations or repeated work.

### 4. Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm makes a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, to find an overall optimal solution.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Local Optimal Choice**: Always choose the best option available at the current step.
- **Global Optimal Solution**: The sum of local optimal choices leads to a global optimal solution.

#### Example:

Coin change problem: Given a list of coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins to make a certain amount.

```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    total_coins = 0
    for coin in coins:
        while amount >= coin:
            amount -= coin
            total_coins += 1
    return total_coins

print(coin_change([1, 5, 10, 25], 63))  # Output: 6 (25 + 25 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1)
```

### 5. Basic Python Programming

Basic proficiency in Python includes understanding loops, conditionals, functions, and basic data structures.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Loops**: For and while loops for iteration.
- **Conditionals**: If-else statements for decision-making.
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions.

#### Example:

Check if a number is prime:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(is_prime(29))  # Output: True
```

### Applying the Concepts to an Example Problem

Let's say we have an interview problem: Given a number `n`, find the sum of its prime factors.

#### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Prime Factorization**: Find the prime factors of `n`.
2. **Dynamic Programming (Optional)**: If there are multiple queries, use DP to store results.
3. **Optimization**: Ensure the solution is efficient by using appropriate algorithms.
4. **Python Basics**: Implement the solution using loops, conditionals, and functions.

#### Example Solution:

```python
def sum_prime_factors(n):
    def prime_factors(n):
        factors = []
        divisor = 2
        while n > 1:
            while n % divisor == 0:
                factors.append(divisor)
                n //= divisor
            divisor += 1
        return factors

    factors = prime_factors(n)
    return sum(factors)

print(sum_prime_factors(28))  # Output: 11 (2 + 2 + 7)
```

This solution finds the prime factors of `n` and then sums them up.
