Let's break down the concepts needed to solve this kind of problem step by step.

### 1. **2D Arrays (Matrices)**

A 2D array, or matrix, is like a grid with rows and columns. For example:

```python
grid = [
    [1, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 1]
]
```

Here, `grid[0][0]` accesses the first element (1), and `grid[2][2]` accesses the last element (1). To iterate over all elements, you can use nested loops:

```python
for row in range(len(grid)):
    for col in range(len(grid[0])):
        print(grid[row][col])
```

### 2. **Navigating Through Adjacent Cells**

In a 2D grid, each cell has up to four neighbors: left, right, top, and bottom. To navigate:

- **Left**: `grid[row][col-1]`
- **Right**: `grid[row][col+1]`
- **Top**: `grid[row-1][col]`
- **Bottom**: `grid[row+1][col]`

### 3. **Conditional Logic**

You can apply conditions to check the value of a cell and its neighbors. For example, if you're checking for land cells (let's say land is represented by `1`), you can write:

```python
if grid[row][col] == 1:
    # Check neighbors to see if they contribute to the perimeter
```

### 4. **Counting Techniques**

To count the perimeter of an island, you need to look at each land cell and determine how many of its edges are water or boundaries of the grid. Each such edge contributes to the perimeter:

```python
perimeter = 0
if grid[row][col] == 1:
    if col == 0 or grid[row][col-1] == 0: # Left
        perimeter += 1
    if col == len(grid[0])-1 or grid[row][col+1] == 0: # Right
        perimeter += 1
    if row == 0 or grid[row-1][col] == 0: # Top
        perimeter += 1
    if row == len(grid)-1 or grid[row+1][col] == 0: # Bottom
        perimeter += 1
```
