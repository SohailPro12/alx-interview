To tackle the interview question involving these concepts, let's break down each one and how they fit into the problem of rotating a matrix in Python.

### 1. **Matrix Representation in Python**

A matrix in Python is typically represented as a list of lists. Each inner list represents a row of the matrix.

**Example:**

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

Here, `matrix[0][0]` is `1`, `matrix[1][2]` is `6`, and so on.

### 2. **In-place Operations**

In-place operations modify the data structure without creating a copy. This is important to minimize space complexity.

**Example:**

```python
matrix[0][0] = 10  # Directly modifies the matrix
```

This is an in-place modification.

### 3. **Matrix Transposition**

Transposing a matrix means swapping rows with columns. For a matrix `matrix[i][j]` becomes `matrix[j][i]`.

**Example:**
Original matrix:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```

Transposed matrix:

```
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```

**Python Code to Transpose a Matrix:**

```python
def transpose(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
```

### 4. **Reversing Rows in a Matrix**

After transposing, reversing each row will rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

**Example:**
Transposed matrix:

```
1 4 7
2 5 8
3 6 9
```

Reversed rows:

```
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
```

**Python Code to Reverse Rows:**

```python
def reverse_rows(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()
```

### 5. **Nested Loops**

Nested loops are used to iterate over the rows and columns of a matrix.

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(len(matrix)):
    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
        print(matrix[i][j], end=" ")
    print()
```

### Summary

- **Matrix Representation:** Use a list of lists to represent the matrix.
- **In-place Operations:** Modify the matrix directly to save space.
- **Matrix Transposition:** Swap rows and columns using nested loops.
- **Reversing Rows:** Reverse each row to achieve the final rotated matrix.
- **Nested Loops:** Essential for iterating over the matrix during transposition and reversal.
