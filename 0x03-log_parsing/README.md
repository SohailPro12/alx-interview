### 1. File I/O in Python

**Concept**: Understand how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.

**Explanation**: `sys.stdin` allows you to read input from the standard input (e.g., the terminal). In many cases, this is useful for reading data provided by the user or another program.

**Example**:

```python
import sys

for line in sys.stdin:
    print(line.strip())
```

- This script reads lines from standard input until EOF is reached and prints each line after stripping any leading/trailing whitespace.

### 2. Signal Handling in Python

**Concept**: Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.

**Explanation**: Signal handling allows your program to gracefully handle interruptions such as `KeyboardInterrupt`.

**Example**:

```python
import signal
import sys

def signal_handler(sig, frame):
    print('You pressed Ctrl+C!')
    sys.exit(0)

signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)

print('Press Ctrl+C')
while True:
    pass
```

- This script catches the `SIGINT` signal (generated by Ctrl+C) and exits the program gracefully.

### 3. Data Processing

**Concept**: Parsing strings to extract specific data points and aggregating data to compute summaries.

**Explanation**: Data processing involves extracting relevant data from raw input and performing computations or aggregations on it.

**Example**:

```python
data = "name: John Doe, age: 30, email: john.doe@example.com"
parts = data.split(", ")
info = {}
for part in parts:
    key, value = part.split(": ")
    info[key] = value

print(info)
```

- This script parses a string to extract key-value pairs and stores them in a dictionary.

### 4. Regular Expressions

**Concept**: Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.

**Explanation**: Regular expressions (regex) allow you to match patterns in strings, which is useful for validation and parsing.

**Example**:

```python
import re

pattern = r"^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$"  # Pattern for a social security number
ssn = "123-45-6789"

if re.match(pattern, ssn):
    print("Valid SSN")
else:
    print("Invalid SSN")
```

- This script checks if a string matches the pattern for a social security number.

### 5. Dictionaries in Python

**Concept**: Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.

**Explanation**: Dictionaries are useful for storing and counting data.

**Example**:

```python
log_entries = [
    "200 512",
    "404 123",
    "200 256",
    "200 1024",
    "404 512"
]

status_counts = {}
file_sizes = {}

for entry in log_entries:
    status, size = entry.split()
    status = int(status)
    size = int(size)

    if status not in status_counts:
        status_counts[status] = 0
    status_counts[status] += 1

    if status not in file_sizes:
        file_sizes[status] = 0
    file_sizes[status] += size

print("Status Counts:", status_counts)
print("File Sizes:", file_sizes)
```

- This script counts the occurrences of status codes and accumulates file sizes from log entries.

### 6. Exception Handling

**Concept**: Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.

**Explanation**: Exception handling allows your program to manage errors gracefully.

**Example**:

```python
try:
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        data = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

- This script attempts to read a file and handles cases where the file may not exist or other errors occur.
